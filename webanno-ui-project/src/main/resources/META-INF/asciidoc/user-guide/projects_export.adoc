Two modes of exporting projects are supported:

   * *Export the whole project* for the purpose of creating a backup, of migrating it to a new {product-name} version, of migrating to a different {product-name} instance, or simply in order to re-import it as a duplicate copy.
   * *Export curated documents* for the purpose of getting an easy access to the final annotation results. If you do not have any curated documents in your project, this export option is not offered. A re-import
of these archives is not possible.

A *whole project* export always serves as an archive which can be re-imported again since it includes
the annotations in the format internally used by the application. In addition to the internal format, the annotations can be included in a secondary format in the export. This format is controlled by the *Format* drop-down field. When *AUTO* is selected, the file format corresponds to the format of the source document. If there is no write support for the source format, the file is exported in the WebAnno TSV3 format instead.

NOTE: The *AUTO* format export annotated files in the format of the originally imported file. If
      the original file format did not contain any annotations (e.g. plain text files) or only specific 
      types of annotations (e.g. CoNLL files), the secondary annotation files will also have none or limited
      annotations. 

When exporting a whole project, the structure of the exported ZIP file is as follows:

====
* *<project ID>.json* - project metadata file
* *annotation*
** *<source document name>*
*** *<user ID>.XXX* - file representing the annotations for this user in the selected format. 
*** *CORRECTION_USER.XXX* - _correction_ project: original document state, _automation_ project 
    automatically generated suggestions
* *annotation_ser*
** *<source document name>*
*** *<user ID>.ser* - serialized CAS file representing the annotations for this user
*** *CORRECTION_USER.ser* - _correction_ project: original document state, _automation_ project 
    automatically generated suggestions
* *curation*
** *<source document name>*
*** *CURATION_USER.XXX* - file representing the state of curation in the selected format.
* *curation_ser*
** *<source document name>*
*** *CURATION_USER.ser* - serialized UIMA CAS representing the state of curation
* *log*
** *<project ID>.log* - project log file
* *source* - folder containing the original source files
====

NOTE: Some browsers automatically extract ZIP files into a folder after the download. Zipping this
      folder and trying to re-import it into the application will generally not work because the process
      introduces an additional folder level within the archive. The
      best option is to disable the automatic extraction in your browser. E.g. in Safari, go to
      *Preferences* -> *General* and disable the setting *Open "safe" files after downloading*.

NOTE: The files under `annotation` and `curation` are provided for convenience only. They are 
      ignored upon import.
      
NOTE: The `CORRECTION_USER.XXX` and `CURATION_USER.ser` may be located in the `curation` and
     `curation_ser` folders for old exported projects.

Currently, it is not possible to choose a specific format for bulk-exporting annotations. However, link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/webanno-user/X3ShaFPXQT0/PnBzpPdXrIgJ[this mailing list post] describes how link:https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/[DKPro Core] can be used to transform the UIMA CAS formats into alternative formats.
